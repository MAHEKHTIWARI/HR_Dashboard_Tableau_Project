## Overview
This project is an end-to-end HR dashboard built using Tableau, following the YouTube tutorial by "Data With Baraa" ([YouTube Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcGF09Awm4Y)). The dashboard visualizes key HR metrics and insights using a provided dataset, offering a comprehensive practice for Tableau users to enhance their data visualization skills.

## Project Description
The goal of this project is to create an interactive HR dashboard in Tableau to analyze employee data, including metrics such as employee demographics, performance, and other HR-related insights. The dashboard is built using the `HumanResources.csv` dataset provided in the downloadable project materials.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is `HumanResources.csv`, included in the `Tableau-HR-Project-Materials.zip` file. You can find the download instructions in the `DOWNLOAD_REQUIRED_DATA_FILES_FROM_HERE.md` file.

### Optional: Generating Fake HR Data
To practice generating synthetic HR data, you can use the Python script `code_to_generate_faker_data.py`. This script was created using a ChatGPT prompt from the `Chat_gpt_prompt_to_create_Faker_data.txt` file. Note that this script generates a different dataset from the one used in the Tableau dashboard (`HumanResources.csv`), but it can be useful for experimenting with similar HR data generation.

## Prerequisites
- **Tableau**: Ensure you have Tableau Desktop or Tableau Public installed to build and view the dashboard.
- **Python (Optional)**: If you plan to generate synthetic HR data, you need Python installed with the `faker` library. Install it using:
  ```bash
  pip install faker
  ```
- **Dataset**: Download the `Tableau-HR-Project-Materials.zip` file and extract `HumanResources.csv` for the Tableau dashboard.

## Steps to Reproduce
1. **Download the Dataset**:
   - Refer to `DOWNLOAD_REQUIRED_DATA_FILES_FROM_HERE.md` for instructions on downloading `Tableau-HR-Project-Materials.zip`.
   - Extract the `HumanResources.csv` file.

2. **Set Up Tableau**:
   - Open Tableau Desktop or Tableau Public.
   - Import the `HumanResources.csv` file as your data source.
   - Follow the steps outlined in the YouTube tutorial by "Data With Baraa" ([link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcGF09Awm4Y)) to create the HR dashboard.

3. **Optional: Generate Synthetic Data**:
   - If you want to experiment with synthetic data, run the `code_to_generate_faker_data.py` script.
   - Ensure the `faker` library is installed (see Prerequisites).
   - The script uses the logic from the `Chat_gpt_prompt_to_create_Faker_data.txt` prompt to generate a synthetic HR dataset.

4. **Build the Dashboard**:
   - Follow the YouTube tutorial to create visualizations such as employee demographics, performance metrics, and other HR insights.
   - Customize the dashboard layout and filters as needed to enhance interactivity.

## Files in the Project
- **HumanResources.csv**: The primary dataset used for the Tableau dashboard (included in `Tableau-HR-Project-Materials.zip`).
- **code_to_generate_faker_data.py**: Python script to generate synthetic HR data using the `faker` library.
- **Chat_gpt_prompt_to_create_Faker_data.txt**: The ChatGPT prompt used to create the `code_to_generate_faker_data.py` script.
- **DOWNLOAD_REQUIRED_DATA_FILES_FROM_HERE.md**: Instructions for downloading the required dataset.
- **README.md**: This file, providing an overview and instructions for the project.

## Notes
- The `HumanResources.csv` file is the primary dataset for the Tableau dashboard, as it aligns with the tutorial by "Data With Baraa."
- The synthetic data generated by `code_to_generate_faker_data.py` may differ from the `HumanResources.csv` dataset and is intended for practice or experimentation.
- Ensure you follow the YouTube tutorial closely for accurate dashboard creation, as it provides detailed steps for buildingellia
